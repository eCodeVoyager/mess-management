### Bachelor Home Management System (BHMS) Requirements and Implementation Plan

#### System/App Workflow

1. **User Management**
    - **New Member Registration**: Only an admin can create a user account for a new member.
    - **Profile Update**: New members must update their profile information, including:
        - Security documents (e.g., NID, Birth Certificate)
        - Emergency contact information
    - **Public Profile**: Users can view a list of current users and visit their profiles for any public information.

2. **Meal Management**
    - **Daily Meal Update**: Users can update their meal preferences for up to the next 10 days.
    - **Meal Timing**: Users must update their meal preferences at least 2 hours before meal time.
    - **Meal Calculation**: At the end of the month, the total meal expenses are divided by the total number of meals to determine the meal rate. This data is shown in a table format.

3. **Expense Management**
    - **Market Duty Expenses**: Only the assigned market duty member can add expenses for the day.
    - **Expense Approval**: Other members can add expenses, but these must be approved by an admin.
    - **Monthly Expense Calculation**: At the end of the month, calculate the meal rate and the total meal expense for each member, auto-generate this data, and send notifications to pay.

4. **Market Duty Roster**
    - **Auto-Assignment**: The system auto-assigns market duty to users based on an algorithm that considers total members and their availability.
    - **Availability**: Members can add their free and busy days to their profile so the market duty roster can assign duties accordingly.
    - **Duty Withdrawal**: Members can withdraw from market duty, but only if another member accepts the duty. Otherwise, they must fulfill their duty.
    - **Notifications**: The system sends notifications to users about their market duty assignments.

5. **Reports Generation**
    - **Daily, Weekly, Monthly Reports**: The system auto-generates reports on expenses and meal consumption.

6. **Notifications**
    - **System Notifications**: The entire system relies heavily on notifications to keep users informed about duties, pending payments, and other important updates.

2. **Expense Management**
    - RESTful APIs to track food market expenses and other communal expenses.
    - Divide expenses among all residents.
    - Generate detailed expense reports via API.

3. **Meal Management**
    - RESTful APIs to track daily meal consumption.
    - Calculate meal prices based on market expenses.
    - Provide a monthly meal price breakdown via API.

4. **Market Duty Roster**
    - RESTful APIs to assign market duty to residents.
    - Create a roster to define who is responsible for purchasing groceries.

5. **Reports Generation**
    - Generate monthly and weekly reports of expenses and meal consumption.
    - Export reports in PDF format via API.

6. **Notifications**
    - APIs to notify users about their duties, pending payments, and other important updates via email/SMS.

**Should Have**

1. **In-App Notifications**
    - Real-time notifications within the app using WebSockets.

2. **Database Management**
    - Efficient MongoDB schema design to handle large datasets.
    - Indexing for faster query performance.

**Could Have**

1. **Additional Language Support**
    - APIs to support more languages based on user demand.

2. **Mobile Responsiveness**
    - Ensure APIs are optimized for mobile app consumption.

**Wonâ€™t Have**

1. **Advanced Analytics**
    - Complex data analysis and forecasting features will not be included in the initial version.

### Method

#### Architecture Overview
The BHMS backend will follow a modular and scalable architecture, leveraging the MERN stack components (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with a focus on the backend.

```plantuml

### Implementation Plan

#### Step 1: Project Setup
- Initialize Project:
    - Create a new Node.js project using `npm init`.
    - Set up the directory structure.
    - Install necessary dependencies: Express.js, Mongoose, JWT, Nodemailer (for notifications), etc.
    - Set up Git for version control.

- Configure Environment Variables:
    - Create a `.env` file to store environment-specific configurations (e.g., database URI, JWT secret, email service credentials).

#### Step 2: Database Setup
- MongoDB Configuration:
    - Set up MongoDB Atlas for a cloud-hosted database solution.
    - Create a new database for BHMS.

- Define Schemas:
    - Define Mongoose schemas and models for User, Expense, Meal, Duty, and Notification.

#### Step 3: Authentication Service
- User Registration and Login:
    - Implement user registration (`POST /api/auth/register`) and login (`POST /api/auth/login`).
    - Use bcrypt to hash passwords.
    - Generate JWT tokens for authenticated users.

- User Profile Management:
    - Implement profile retrieval endpoint (`GET /api/auth/profile`).

#### Step 4: Expense Management
- CRUD Operations:
    - Implement endpoints to add (`POST /api/expenses`), list (`GET /api/expenses`), update (`PUT /api/expenses/:id`), and delete expenses (`DELETE /api/expenses/:id`).
    - Ensure that non-market duty expenses require admin approval.

- Expense Reports:
    - Implement report generation endpoint (`GET /api/expenses/report`).

#### Step 5: Meal Management
- CRUD Operations:
    - Implement endpoints to add (`POST /api/meals`), list (`GET /api/meals`), update (`PUT /api/meals/:id`), and delete meal records

 (`DELETE /api/meals/:id`).

- Meal Reports:
    - Implement report generation endpoint (`GET /api/meals/report`).

#### Step 6: Market Duty Management
- CRUD Operations:
    - Implement endpoints to assign (`POST /api/duties`), list (`GET /api/duties`), update (`PUT /api/duties/:id`), and delete duties (`DELETE /api/duties/:id`).

#### Step 7: Notification Service
- Email and SMS Notifications:
    - Implement endpoints to send email (`POST /api/notifications/email`) and SMS notifications (`POST /api/notifications/sms`).
    - Integrate with email and SMS gateways (e.g., Nodemailer for email, Twilio for SMS).

- In-App Notifications:
    - Use WebSockets to implement real-time notifications within the app.

#### Step 8: Testing
- Unit Testing:
    - Write unit tests for each service using a testing framework like Mocha or Jest.

- Integration Testing:
    - Test the integration between different services and MongoDB.

- API Testing:
    - Use Postman to test all API endpoints and ensure they are working as expected.

#### Step 9: Deployment
- Backend Deployment:
    - Deploy the backend on Heroku.
    - Set up environment variables on Heroku.

- Database Deployment:
    - Ensure MongoDB Atlas is properly configured and connected to the backend.

#### Step 10: Post-Deployment
- Monitoring:
    - Monitor the application using tools like Heroku's built-in monitoring, or third-party services like New Relic.

- Bug Fixes and Improvements:
    - Collect user feedback and make necessary improvements.
    - Fix any bugs reported post-deployment.
